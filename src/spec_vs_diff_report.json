  "summary": "REQ-51 is partially evidenced: `compareByTimestamp` was added/updated to return `Order.Order` and compare `timestamp` values (descending/newest-first). However, the diff summary is truncated before `getAllQualifications()`, so the required replacement of the invalid `allQualifications.sort(...)` usage and preservation of admin-only authorization for that endpoint are not verifiable from the provided changes. REQ-52 (end-to-end deploy flow + regenerated frontend bindings) is not evidenced by the diff summary. The diff also contains indications of substantial frontend/product work (landing page redesign, member dashboard, /member route) that are out of scope for a go-live deployment-blocker fix.",
