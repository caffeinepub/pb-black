  "summary": "Redesign PB Black landing page to feel ultra-premium, exclusive, private banking-grade for invite-only HNI insurance concierge in India (hero→eligibility→claims story→comparison→proof→qualification form→what happens next) with authoritative minimal tone + CTA, and redesign the onboarded member dashboard into a private-insurance command-center experience (advisory, intelligent, uncluttered, dark luxury with gold accents).",
  "architectural_notes": [
    "Use a black & gold premium visual theme consistent across landing and apply flow.",
    "Plan for LinkedIn OAuth / LinkedIn profile data capture as the primary identity source for applications.",
    "Model post-application states (requested → approved/denied → enrolled) and manager assignment.",
    "Add a post-enrollment member dashboard page that surfaces assigned manager contact (including WhatsApp deep link) and a simple policies dashboard with actions (connect/request callback/schedule in-person or video meeting).",
    "Include a landing-page section that frames PB Black value by listing key current insurance ecosystem pain points (multiple PoCs, outdated policies/offerings, lack of claims-time assistance, lack of renewal/update concierge).",
    "Rename the landing-page section header from \"Current Issues in the Insurance Ecosystem\" to \"Insurance related challenges you must be facing today in your busy life\".",
    "Adopt an authoritative, exclusive, minimal, confident (not salesy/discount-oriented) tone across the landing page; avoid long paragraphs; use short bold headings.",
    "Landing page structure to follow: Hero (CTA “Check If You Qualify”) → Eligibility → Moment of Truth (claims) → Comparison table → Proof → Qualification form → What Happens Next; include scarcity messaging (limited quarterly onboarding).",
    "Public-facing UI must not expose admin UI elements or non-PB branding (e.g., caffeine branding) on the landing page.",
    "Member dashboard UX direction: advisory/command-center (not CRM-like/transactional); reduce button clutter; use collapsible policy cards with a single primary CTA; include sections for Insights, Coverage Gap Analysis, Claims Readiness, Upcoming Actions, and Privileges; maintain dark luxury theme with gold accents and ample whitespace."

    "Landing page: PB logo in the top/header is being cut/clipped.",
    "Landing page: hero headline typography is too large and copy needs to be more crisp and to the point.",
